#### Background

> I used Apple Notes for many years, it saves most of my work notes, the best thing is it can sync with different Apple device as long as you login with your apple ID
>
> I was going to switch one Apple notes from one apple ID to another, when I did merge, all notes disappeared 
>
> After that, I switched to Evernote free version
>
> Personally view Evernote &gt; Apple Notes
